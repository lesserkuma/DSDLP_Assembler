# DSDLP Assembler (by Lesserkuma)
A tool for creating DS Download Play binaries from Wi-Fi packets and Nintendo Channel DLC files.

For the RSA signature verification to work, put the 128 byte `pubkey.bin` in the same directory. Correct key starts with `9E C1 CC C0` and it can be found in a file called `dlplay.nds`.

The Windows executable is available in the [Releases](https://github.com/lesserkuma/DSDLP_Assembler/releases) section.
